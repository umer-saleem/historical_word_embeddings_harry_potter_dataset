# Historical Word Embeddings:Harry Potter Movies Dataset
## Introduction
This project is focused on analyzing the text data of Harry Potter movies using word embedding techniques. The goal is to learn the meaning of words in a high-dimensional space and analyze relationships between them. The project includes preprocessing of the text data, training of word embeddings, and analysis of word similarity, and relationship.

# Data
The data used for this project is the subtitle files of Harry Potter movies, which are available on the internet. The subtitle files were parsed to extract the text, and then processed to remove stop words, punctuation marks, and special characters. The final preprocessed text was used for training of the word embeddings.
